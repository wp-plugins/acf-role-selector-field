# ACF - Role Selector Field

This plugin adds a user role selector to ACF, allowing you to select one or more user roles using a customizable field.

Welcome to the role selector for Advanced custom fields. For information about the base plugin which is required for the role selector to work, take a look at [ACF on Github](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf) or the official [ACF Homepage](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).
